  "body": "This issue is to open up a discussion on whether scalafmt should also issue warnings alongside formatting code. This could be as simple as adding a `warnings: Seq[Warning]` member to [FormatResult.Success](https://github.com/olafurpg/scalafmt/blob/cb663557e207f04f8b164ca86eb2af119c6f6ca3/core/src/main/scala/org/scalafmt/FormatResult.scala#L15).\r\n\r\nI have received several suggestions online and offline about this. One example is #281. I also believe scalafmt could emit useful warnings about possible code smells (when the search state explodes as in #278).\r\n"
