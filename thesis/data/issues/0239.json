      "body": "I agree this could be handy. However, consider that a lack of a .scalafmt file in your project will make it hard for other contributors to use the same configurationÂ as you.\r\n\r\nI welcome contributions on this issue, since it's not a feature I would use myself and implementing it requires no knowledge about the formatting internals. A good start would be to setup the [intellij](https://github.com/olafurpg/scalafmt/tree/master/intellij) project and start hacking on [ScalafmtAction](https://github.com/olafurpg/scalafmt/blob/master/intellij/src/org/scalafmt/intellij/ScalafmtAction.scala). To test your changes, do Run > Run plugin.\r\n\r\nI'm happy with either a global .scalafmt file or an IntelliJ level configuration, although I would say that a global .scalafmt file is probably easier to implement and it plays nicer with other editor integrations."
