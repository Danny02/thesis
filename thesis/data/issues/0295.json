      "body": "I'm a few hours late to the party, but a thought I had is that it would be nice to be able to configure an \"ignore\" file pattern that would allow users to configure scalafmt to not reformat files on compile which have editor buffer files.  For example, a file named `Stuff.scala` might have a file named `Stuff.scala.swp` or `#Stuff.scala#` in the same directory (representing VI and jEdit, respectively).  Basically all editors have some file pattern of this sort, and it indicates that the editor in question has a dirty buffer of that file.\r\n\r\nDirty buffers are exactly the situation in which reformat-on-compile doesn't play nicely, so the best solution would be if scalafmt just ignored files which match that pattern.  One idea would be that the scalafmt SBT plugin could have a setting (of type `Seq[(Regex, String => String)]`) with some default patterns for the common editors, and users could add patterns as they will if they're using something unusual.  The semantics of that type, btw, would be that scalafmt could use the `Regex` as a quick check to rapidly determine whether or not a file in question *could* be a buffer, while the `String => String` would take the name of a full file (e.g. `Stuff.scala`) and compute its buffer peer (e.g. `#Stuff.scala#`)."
