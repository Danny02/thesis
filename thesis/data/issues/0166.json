      "body": "In 0.2.4, scalafmt will keep the body of an if/else on a separate line if it was already on a separate line. This means it won't move bodies into a single line unless you put them on a single line. Although this doesn't go the full way towards automating the style guide, I believe it's a good start. WDYT?"
