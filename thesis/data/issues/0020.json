  "body": "The column limit penalty, if any, is added to each split cost.\r\n\r\nA split can attach a strategy to itself to limit/enchance future splits,\r\nfor example if we want to do a one-line block we don't want to allow\r\nsplits inside the block. The current implementation has limitations\r\nshown in basic.test."
