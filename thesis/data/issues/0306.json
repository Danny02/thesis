  "body": "I recently ran into a user transitioning from Java who found some Scala code harder to read and maintain because of the implicit types. He wants the ability to make the types explicit using some tool. One person suggested \"It's probably easier to add this [feature] to scalafmt, which uses scala.meta to format code. It wouldn't be too difficult to use scala.meta to get the type an expression and add it if it missing.\"\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?"
