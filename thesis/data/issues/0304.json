To be frank however, this falls quite low on my priority list since I don't use brace grouped import statements ðŸ˜œ I prefer to expand each import into a separate line. For that reason, I put the \"help wanted\" label.\r\n\r\nRefactoring like thisÂ are usually done in the `FormatWriter`. However, I'm not sure if that's the best place for it, will need more time to think about it. I'm happy to help find a good solution if anyone is interested in taking a stab at this."
