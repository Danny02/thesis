      "body": "I personally dislike the unicode arrows for several reasons. Most importantly, unicode arrow are not present in most standard keyboard layouts (hence, a tool is needed to insert them). Also, editing in vim I often run `dt=` to delete up to a `=>` but when the arrow is unicode I can't do that.\r\n\r\nI haven't heard a compelling reason why unicode symbol are better than regular ascii characters. I'm open to change my mind, so I assigned the \"up for debate\" label.\r\n\r\nFor now, my vote goes to encourage people to rewrite their unicode symbols to regular arrows:\r\n```\r\nfind . -type f -name \"*.scala\" -exec sed -i '' \"s/⇒/=>/\" {} \\;\r\n```\r\n\r\nPS. @easel Please use the thumbs up reaction instead of commenting +1."

      "body": "Our project uses unicode arrows, and we love them (or I force everyone to love them, IDK...) because:\r\n- they're one symbol instead of two and they don't make sense parted like `=` plus `>`, only as `⇒` (especially if you navigate a line using arrow keys)\r\n- they're beautiful (this one is legit, eh?)\r\n- mother of god unicode symbols in my code ♥ !!! \r\n\r\nAlso, that heart-shaped unicode bit and the arrow above were legitimately typed in a few keystrokes with XCompose which is buried so deep in X server I can't even call it a separate tool.\r\n\r\nI don't want to include any `find ...` script as a part of our code because scalafmt does an awesome job grooming our code style without any weird supports like custom scripts and commit hooks.\r\n\r\nSo I'd love to see this feature, maybe just disable it by default @olafurpg?"
