  "body": "Most notably: new def, class and interpolate tests (some failing)!\r\nAlong the way:\r\n* add docstrings to Debug and ScalaFmt.\r\n* the formatter returns the longest found solution when search space is\r\n  too big.\r\n* Statements inside blocks are recursed on, see getStatementStarts.\r\n* add origin field to splits, to aid debugging output.\r\n* refactored FormatTest into smaller functions.\r\n* refactored src/test/resources into directories. The directory\r\n  determines the ScalaStyle used.\r\n* fixed a few bugs here and there."
