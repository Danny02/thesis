  "body": "The indentation is managed by `State.indent: Int`. Splits and policies can increment/decrement the int.\r\n\r\n* This makes it tricky for example to indent a function argument to the same column as the opening `(` because we don't know the exact integer value of the state's column.\r\n* unindenting the same number of spaces at the closing `)` requires us to know integer value at the opening `)`\r\n* We violate DRY by relying on decrementing the same number as we increment.\r\n\r\nA more powerful abstraction would work like a stack, you push an `Indent` which can be a concrete number or a usefulÂ object like state.column"
