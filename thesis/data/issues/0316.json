The following are equivalent:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nfoo:\r\n  a: 1\r\n  b: 2\r\n\r\n# and this\r\n\r\nfoo: { a: 1, b: 2 }\r\n```\r\n\r\nBasically, commas and curly braces are inferred in the primary syntax (the upper example, which is whitespace-sensitive), just as semicolons are inferred in hocon.\r\n\r\nIf representing a list of values, a similarly json-like syntax is inferred:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nfoo:\r\n  - a \r\n  - b\r\n\r\n# and this\r\n\r\nfoo: [ a, b ]\r\n```\r\n\r\nBTW, YAML also has support for references, which is something that people have a tendency to forget about (since very few configuration formats support it).  For an example, see here: https://gist.github.com/bowsersenior/979804  Among other things, this allows YAML to natively support serialization of recursive data structures.  This is completely irrelevant for scalafmt, but it's still interesting."

Not sure if that's the way to go but it's worth a look. Thanks for the input everybody.\r\n"
