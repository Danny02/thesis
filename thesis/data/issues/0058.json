  "body": "* Fix output for remaining ugliest parts of Formatter.scala, including\r\n* sequences of select/apply: a.b(c.d).e(f).g. PROBLEM: this again causes\r\n  formatter to choke.\r\n* Await for 20 seconds to submit results if running on Travis.\r\n* Treat blocks inside arguments as 1 character width.  Not sure if this\r\n  makes sense in all cases, but gives nice results in my tests."
