Scalariform does not sort imports for the same reason, as discussed here: https://github.com/scala-ide/scalariform/issues/67 I agree with mdr's comment that this functionality probably belongs in a different tool such as scala-refactoring.\r\n\r\nUntil then, I recommend using the IntelliJ import optimizer."
