\section{Conclusion}
We set out to implement a code formatter for the Scala programming language that supports several important features: an opinionated setting, a maximum line length setting, vertical alignment and fast performance.
We have presented data structures and algorithms that enabled us to develop scalafmt, a Scala code formatter that supports the first three required features and goes far towards achieving good performance.
Benchmarks reveal that scalafmt can format over 100 thousand lines of code in only 15 seconds.
However, scalafmt is still 6x slower than Scalariform, an alternative Scala code formatter.
User adoption of scalafmt indicates that scalafmt's features are valuable and that the current performance is acceptable for many software developers.
We believe there is plenty of room for improvements on making scalafmt go further and meet the needs of the even the most demanding users.
