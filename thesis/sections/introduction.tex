Without code formatters, software developers are responsible for manipulating all syntactic trivia in their programs.
What is syntactic trivia?
Consider the Scala code snippets in listings~\ref{lst:unformatted} and~\ref{lst:formatted1}.

\begin{minipage}{.45\textwidth}
\lstinputlisting[label={lst:unformatted}, caption=Unformatted code]{code/unformatted.scala}
\end{minipage}
\hfil
\begin{minipage}{.45\textwidth}
\lstinputlisting[label={lst:formatted1}, caption=Formatted code]{target/formatted1.scala}
\end{minipage}

Both snippets represent the same program.
The only difference lies in where the programmer has chosen to break lines.
Characters that don't affect the execution of the program --- such as spaces and line breaks --- are syntactic trivia.
Although syntactic trivia does not alter the execution of the program, listing~\ref{lst:formatted1} is arguably easier to read, understand and maintain for the software developer.
The promise of code formatters is to automatically convert any program that may contain style issues, such as in listing~\ref{lst:unformatted}, into a readable and consistent looking program, such as in listing~\ref{lst:formatted1}.
Code formatting brings several benefits to software development.

Code formatting enables automated large-scale refactoring.
Google used ClangFormat\autocite{jasper_clangformat_2013}, a code formatter, to migrate legacy C++ code to the modern C++11 standard\autocite{wright_large-scale_2013}.
ClangFormat was used to ensure that the refactored code adhered to Google's strict C++ coding style\autocite{_google_????}.
Similar migrations can be expected in the near future for the Scala community once new dialects, such as Dotty\autocite{rompf_f_2015}, gain popularity.

Code formatting is valuable in collaborative coding environments.
The Scala.js project\autocite{_scala.js_????} has over 40 contributors and the Scala.js coding style\autocite{doeraene_scala.js_2015} --- which each Scala.js contributor is expected to know by heart --- is defined at a whopping 2.600 word count.
Each contributed patch is manually verified against the coding style by the project maintainers.
This adds a burden on both contributors and maintainers.
Several prominent Scala community members have raised this issue.
ENSIME\autocite{_ensime_????} is a popular Scala interaction mode for text editors such as Vim and Emacs.
Sam Halliday, an ENSIME maintainer, says ``I don't have time to talk about formatting in code reviews. I want the machine to do it so I can focus on the design.''\autocite{halliday_i_2016-1}.
Akka\autocite{_akka_????} is a popular concurrent and distributed programming library for Scala with over 300 contributors.
Viktor Klang, a maintainer of Akka, suggests a better alternative ``Code style should not be enforced by review, but by automate rewriting. Evolve the style using PRs against the rewriting config.''.\autocite{klang_code_2016}.
With code formatters, software developers are not burdened by syntactic trivia and can instead direct their full attention to writing correct, maintainable and fast code.

\subsection{Contributions}
The main contributions presented in this thesis are the following:
\begin{itemize}
  \item algorithms and data structures to implement line wrapping with a maximum column-width limit --- in our experience, the most challenging part of developing scalafmt --- as well as configurable vertical alignment.
    This work is presented in section~\ref{sec:algorithms}.
  \item tools to develop and test the presented algorithms.
    This work is presented in section~\ref{sec:tooling}.
  \item practical validation of developed algorithms and methods with scalafmt, a code formatter for the Scala programming language.
    The empirical results of this validation are presented in section~\ref{sec:evaluation}.
\end{itemize}
