The main contributions presented in this thesis are the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A DSL for declaring feature-rich code formatting rules.
    \item An case study where the DSL is used to format Scala programs.
\end{itemize}
Throughout the paper we assume familiarity with the basics of the Scala
Programming Language~\autocite{odersky_scala_2004}.
