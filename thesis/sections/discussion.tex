\section{Conclusion}
We set out to design abstractions that enable us to implement a code formatter for the Scala programming language that supports several important features: an opinionated setting, a maximum line length setting, vertical alignment and fast performance.
In this thesis, we have presented data structures and algorithms that we used to develop scalafmt, a Scala code formatter.
Our evaluation shows that scalafmt meets the first three requirements and goes a far to achieve good performance.
Our micro and macro benchmarks reveals that scalafmt is still 6x slower than Scalariform, an alternative Scala code formatter.
We estimate that scalafmt has currently around 1.000 active users.
The user adoption of scalafmt indicates that scalafmt's current performance is acceptable for many software developers.


% By achieving this goal, we hope to capture many popular Scala coding styles and idioms enabling the Scala community to enjoy the benefits that come with code formatting.
