\section{Discussion}
We set out to find out whether we could develop a code formatter for the Scala programming language.
The code formatter should capture many popular Scala coding styles and idioms;
support line wrapping with a maximum line length setting, and be able to vertically align tokens.
Our evaluation shows that.
We presented scalafmt, a Scala code formatter that we believe achieves these goals.
