  Automatic code formatters bring a lot of benefits to software development.
  When done right, code formatters relieve the developer's attention from
  syntactic trivia and enforce a consistent coding style between developers.
  However, developing a good code formatter is still somewhat of a black art and yet,
  little research has been made towards the algorithms that power such code formatters.

  This thesis addresses the problem of developing a feature-rich code formatter for a custom programming language.
  % A critical feature of such a formatter is enforcing a column-width limit, which turns out to be a hard problem.
  Our contributions are twofold.
  First, we present a language agnostic framework that consists of core data structures, algorithms and tooling 
  that allow rapid development and testing of such a code formatter.
  Secondly, we use our model in a case study and provide a concrete implementation of a code formatter, \texttt{scalafmt}.
  We show that the framework makes
