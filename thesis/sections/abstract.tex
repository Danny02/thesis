  Code formatters bring many benefits to software development such as enforcing a consistent coding style across teams, more effective code reviews and enabling automated large-scale refactoring.
  Still, code formatters can be tricky to get right.
  This thesis addresses the problem of developing a code formatter for the Scala programming language.
  We present scalafmt, an opinionated Scala code formatter that captures many popular Scala idioms and coding styles.
  This thesis introduces the algorithms and tooling we used to implement advanced features such as line wrapping and configurable vertical alignment.
  We have validated that these techniques work well in practice.
  Scalafmt has been installed over 6.500 times in only 3 months and
  several popular open-source libraries have chosen to reformat their codebases with scalafmt.
