  Automatic code formatters bring many benefits to software development.
  When done right, code formatters relieve the developer's attention from manipulating
  syntactic trivia while enforcing a consistent coding style between teams.
  Still, little research has been made towards the algorithms and tools that make it possible to develop such code formatters.

  This thesis addresses the problem of developing an advanced code formatter for a custom programming language.
  % A critical feature of such a formatter is enforcing a column-width limit, which turns out to be a hard problem.
  Our contributions are twofold.
  First, we present xmft, a language agnostic framework that consists of core data structures, algorithms and tooling 
  that allow rapid development and testing of such a code formatter.
  Secondly, we provide a implementation of a code formatter, \texttt{scalafmt}, that uses our framework.

  We show that the framework can support rich formatting options such as
  column-width limitation and configurable vertical alignment.
  In one month, the formatter has been installed over 2.000 times and XXX success metric.
